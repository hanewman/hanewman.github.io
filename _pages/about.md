Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Vassar College. 

I obtained my PhD from the unique interdisciplinary <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/math/aco/index.html"> Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) </a> doctoral program (via Math department) at Carnegie Mellon (CMU), where I was fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/"> Ben Moseley. </a>

My research is at the intersection of discrete math, theoretical computer science, and operations research, with a focus on approximation and online algorithms for problems in combinatorial optimization. I am also interested in new beyond-worst-case models, especially for online algorithms with pessimistic lower bounds. I enjoy thinking about problems in clustering and scheduling. 

Before my PhD, I received an A.B. in Math, with a minor in Computer Science, from Princeton in 2019, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from Oxford in 2020.
