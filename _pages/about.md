Welcome! I am a fifth year PhD candidate participating in the unique interdisciplinary <a href="https://aco.math.cmu.edu/"> Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) </a> doctoral program (via Math Department) at Carnegie Mellon (CMU). I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/"> Prof. Ben Moseley. </a>

My research is at the intersection of theoretical computer science and operations research, with a focus on the design and analysis of algorithms that are **fair, fast, and robust to uncertainty**. I am especially interested in beyond-worst-case models for online algorithms with pessimistic lower bounds. I enjoy thinking about problems in clustering and resource allocation, and in particular the problem of correlation clustering.  

Before coming to CMU, I received an A.B. in Math, with a minor in Computer Science, from Princeton in 2019, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from Oxford in 2020.
