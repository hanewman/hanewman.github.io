Welcome! I am a second year PhD candidate participating in the unique interdisciplinary <a href="https://aco.math.cmu.edu/"> Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) </a> doctoral program (via math department) at Carnegie Mellon. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/"> Prof. Ben Moseley. </a>

I am currently doing research in theoretical computer science, with specific interests in approximation algorithms, online algorithms, randomized algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. 

Before coming to CMU, I obtained an A.B. in Math _cum laude_, with a minor in Computer Science, from Princeton in 2019, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences with Distinction from Oxford in 2020. 

In my free time, I enjoy board games, musicals, reading, nuanced conversations, and learning arcane words.
