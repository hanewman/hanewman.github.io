Welcome! I am a fourth year PhD candidate participating in the unique interdisciplinary <a href="https://aco.math.cmu.edu/"> Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO) </a> doctoral program (via Math Department) at Carnegie Mellon (CMU). I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/moseleyb/"> Prof. Ben Moseley. </a>

I am currently doing research in theoretical computer science, with specific interests in approximation algorithms, online algorithms, and combinatorial optimization. 

Before coming to CMU, I received an A.B. in Math, with a minor in Computer Science, from Princeton in 2019, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematical Sciences from Oxford in 2020. 

In my free time, I enjoy board games, plays, reading, walks and runs, and learning new words. 

**Service** 
I have served as a reviewer for AISTATS 2023, ICML 2023, APPROX 2023, NeurIPs 2023, STACS 2024, AISTATS 2024. I was a volunteer at STOC 2022. 
From Fall 2023--Fall 2024, I co-organized the weekly Meet-and-Think Seminar where ACO/OR PhD students, postdocs, and occasionally professors share their ongoing research.
